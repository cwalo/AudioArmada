# Audio Armada # 
#### The beginnings of an iOS audio toolkit ####

I'm starting this as a test bed for mobile audio and framework design. Hopefully it gets to a point that developers can use it in their own applications. 

##### Running the examples #####
The examples have Carthage dependencies, so be sure Carthage is installed, then run:
`carthage update --platform iOS`

##### TODOs #####
* Carthage support
